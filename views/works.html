      <h2>Ray Dalio</h2>
        <h4>
            Professional start
        </h4>
        
After graduating from Harvard, Dalio married and started a family. He moved to Wilton, Connecticut, where he lived and traded out of a converted barn.[23] Dalio then worked on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange and traded commodity futures.[16] He later worked as the Director of Commodities at Dominick & Dominick LLC.[24] In 1974 he became a futures trader and broker at Shearson Hayden Stone, a securities firm[16] run by Sandy Weil, who later became famous for building up Citigroup. At the firm, Dalio's job was to advise cattle ranchers, grain producers, and other farmers on how to hedge risks, primarily with futures.[25] But he was largely dissatisfied with Shearson Hayden Stone's hierarchical structure, which reminded him of primary education. He longed for the more freedom-based lifestyle of college. At one point, he paid a stripper to drop her clothes in front of a crowd at the annual convention of the California Food and Grain Growers' Association.[25] His creative ways of blowing off steam continued, and exploded on New Year's Eve in 1971 after he went out drinking with some colleagues, including his boss. After a disagreement with his superior, a drunk Dalio punched him in the face. Soon afterward, he was let go from his job at Shearson Hayden Stone.[25]

<h4>Founding of Bridgewater Associates</h4>
Despite his aggressive behavior, numerous clients at Shearson Hayden Stone retained their trust in Dalio, and continued to allow him to manage their money. With this capital, he was able to scrape together the beginnings of his asset management fund.[17] In 1975, he founded Bridgewater Associates out of his two-bedroom New York City apartment.[26] Bridgewater started out as a wealth advisory firm, and did so for numerous corporate clients, mostly from Dalio's job at Shearson Hayden Stone.[17] The main areas in which Dalio advised were currencies and interest rates. The company began publishing a paid subscription research report, Daily Observations, in which it analyzed global market trends.[27] Dalio's big break came when McDonald's signed on as a client of his firm. Bridgewater then began to grow rapidly. The firm signed on larger clients, including the pension funds for the World Bank and Eastman Kodak.[28] In 1981 the firm opened an office in Westport, Connecticut, which was where Ray and his wife wanted to start a family.[17] Dalio started to become well-known outside of Wall Street after turning a profit from the 1987 stock market crash. The next year, he appeared on an "Oprah Winfrey Show" episode titled "Do Foreigners Own America?"[28] In 1991, he launched Bridgewater's flagship strategy, "Pure Alpha", a reference to the Greek letter that, in Wall Street terminology, represents the surcharge a money manager can earn above a particular market benchmark, such as the NASDAQ.[29] In 1996, Dalio launched All Weather, a fund that pioneered a steady, low-risk strategy that later became known as risk parity.[28]

<h4>Rise to prominence</h4>

Bridgewater Associates became the world's largest hedge fund in 2005.[26] From 1991 to 2005 it lost money in only three calendar years, and never more than 4%. During the same period, the S&P 500 also had three down years, including a negative return of 22.1% in 2002.[30]The fund grew in size by using the standard hedge fund model, which takes a 2% management fee of assets and 20% of yearly profits accrued from using an investment system.[31] By 2005, Dalio was managing money for extremely large entities, including the $196 billion California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS), the $27 billion Pennsylvania State Employees' Retirement System, Melbourne-based National Australia Bank Ltd. and the pension fund of Hartford, Connecticut-based United Technologies Corp.[30] In 2007, Bridgewater suggested there might be a global financial crisis,[32] and in 2008 Dalio published "How the Economic Machine Works: A Template for Understanding What is Happening Now", an essay assessing the potential of various economies by various criteria.[33] The firm's total assets under management increased to $50 billion in 2007 (up from $33 billion seven years earlier).[34]

According to a 2007 article in Barron's magazine, "nobody was better prepared for the global market crash" than Bridgewater's clients and subscribers to its Daily Observations. The company "began sounding alarms...in the spring of 2007 about the dangers of excessive financial leverage."[35] Researchers at the firm examined the public records of most of the world's largest financial entities and discovered that estimated future liabilities related to bad debts totaled $839 billion. When Dalio met with U.S. Treasury Department staff and other White House economic advisors in December, these findings were disclosed, but were largely ignored.[36] Due to this research, Bridgewater's Pure Alpha fund avoided much of the 2008 stock market implosion for its investors.[37] In 2008, a disastrous year for many of Bridgewater’s rivals, the firm’s flagship Pure Alpha fund rose in value by 9.5% after accounting for fees.[23] Dalio did this by anticipating that the Federal Reserve would be forced to print a lot of money to revive the economy. He went long on Treasury bonds, shorted the dollar, and bought gold and other commodities.[23] During his 2008 presidential campaign, John McCain paid a visit to the firm and spoke to staff.[38] The next year was not as bright. In 2009, when economic growth was higher than expected and the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased by 19%, the company's Pure Alpha fund reportedly earned just 2% to 4%.[37]

In 2011, Dalio self-published a 123-page volume, Principles, that outlines his philosophy of investment and corporate management.[39][40] By that same year, Dalio was managing money for the Pennsylvania Public School Employees’ Retirement System, Kodak, General Motors and the Government Investment Corporation of Singapore.[23] In 2012, he appeared on the annual Time 100 list of the 100 most influential people in the world.[41] In 2011 and 2012, Bloomberg Markets listed him as one of the 50 Most Influential people. Under Dalio's leadership, Bridgewater's Pure Alpha II had just three losing years in its history, with an average return of 10.4%. A stake in Bridgewater Associates Intermediate Holdings, LP was purchased by the Teacher Retirement System of Texas (TRS) for $250 million in February 2012. This stake was non-voting, and thus provided the pension fund with very little control of corporate governance.[42] Institutional Investor's Alpha ranked Dalio No. 2 on its 2012 Rich List.[43][44] Dalio has controlled Bridgewater Associates alongside co-chief investment officers Bob Prince and Greg Jensen since its inception. The hedge fund recently announced plans to reorganize as a partnership. Dalio said the reason for this was the continued sustainability and profit-sharing of the company.[45] Dalio was co-CEO of Bridgewater for 10 months before announcing in March 2017 that he would step down as part of a company-wide shakeup by April 15.[46] The company had been in a seven-year management and equity transition to find a replacement.[47] Jon Rubinstein, co-CEO of the fund, was announced to step down with Dalio, but would retain an advisory role.[46] As of October 2017 Bridgewater Associates had $160 billion in assets under management.[48] In reference to the personality that led him to investment success, Dalio has said that he considers himself a "hyperrealist", and that he is motivated to understand the mechanisms that dictate how the world actually functions, without adding in abstract value judgments.[31]
